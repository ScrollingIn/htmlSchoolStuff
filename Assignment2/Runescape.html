    <div style="background-color: darkslategray; color: white"><h3>About Runescape</h3>
        
        <p>Runescape is an MMORPG, Massively multiplayer online role-playing game, developed and published by Jagex in 2001. The game has changed a lot since then and the version I am going to talk about is Old School Runescape. This version was released on February 22th 2013 in response to the declining playerbase and negative update reception of the original and then-current version of Runescape. Old School Runescape was originally an exact copy of Runescape as it was in August 2007, but has since received engine improvement, new content, and quality of life patches. Proposed gameplay updates to the game are voted on by players, and are only implemented if 75% of paying players accept them. Despite having a smaller staff and a slower relative update schedule, Old School Runescape had more than twice the active players that RuneScape had by 2017. A mobile version of the game for Android and iOS was released on 30 October 2018.</p></div>
    
    <div  style="background-color: darkslategray; color: white">   <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        
        <p>The input mechanics are mainly point-and-click. The player controls a single character and can interact with NPCs, objects, and entities in the game world by left-clicking, or selecting an option from the object's right-click menu, since many objects can offer more than one interaction option.<br>
        Due to the game's simple interface and gameplay mechanics, Old School Runescape has a relatively low bar of entry as opposed to RuneScape or other more complex MMOs. Coupled with the fact that there is a large free-to-play section of the game, it is a popular first game for players that are new to online games.</p>
        
        <h4>Iron(wo)man Mode</h4>
        
        <p>Old School Runescape offers an "Ironman" gamemode wherein players are completely barred from economic interaction with other players, and they must be completely self-sufficient; for example, they cannot use the "Grand Exchange", trade with other players, be assisted in battle (unless it is specified as a group activity), or take items that other players have dropped, sold to stores, or unclaimed loot from monsters killed by them. First introduced in October 2014, this is often considered one of the most difficult ways to play the game, as many late-game items only come from high level bosses and have a small chance of being obtained. Although these accounts can still use all of the game's chat features, the gamemode is often touted as a "single-player" experience due to the necessity of solo exploration of the game world for progression.</p>

        <p>In addition to the standard Ironman mode, players may opt in to one of two further challenge modes. Hardcore Ironman mode applies all of the same restrictions as the standard Ironman account, but with an additional caveat that Hardcore status is revoked if the character reaches zero hitpoints and respawns. Upon death, the account is "demoted" to a standard Ironman. Typically, the goal of a Hardcore Ironman is to progress as far as possible in the game without losing Hardcore status, often resulting in high-risk situations.</p>

        <p>Ultimate Ironman mode places all of the standard Ironman conditions upon the player plus several additional conditions, with the most notable being the inability to use any bank. The restrictions placed upon an Ultimate Ironman, however, do not include the Hardcore restriction; an Ultimate Ironman can die and respawn with Ultimate status intact.</p>
        <h4>Deadman Mode</h4>
        
        <p>Deadman Mode is a separate incarnation of Old School Runescape released on 29 October 2015, which features open-world player versus player combat and accelerated experience rates. If one player kills another, the victor receives a key to a chest letting them loot items from their victim's account. Players who engage other players in combat will be marked with a skull icon â€“ "skulled" players come under attack from NPCs if they try to enter safe cities, and the number of keys they are holding will be visible to other players making them an obvious target. Players who die in Deadman Mode will lose a significant portion of their experience points in all but five skills of the player's choice.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, Jagex hosts separate, recurring "Deadman Tournaments" where players can qualify for a final elimination round, incentivized by monetary prizes. The Autumn Finals of September 2018 boasted a US$20,000 grand prize.</p>
